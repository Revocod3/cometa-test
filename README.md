Complexity of the test code

In the following file you will find two functions:

The first is `isPalindrome` which takes a string as an argument and returns a boolean.

The second is `repeatedLetter` which takes a string as an argument and returns the first repeated letter or `null` if there is no repeated letter.

There are two versions of each function and both were evaluated in terms of Big O, the first function only in time complexity and the second in time and space complexity, and both versions were tested in the same way.

If you want you can test the functions
Running Node, and the file name: test-code-complexity.js
