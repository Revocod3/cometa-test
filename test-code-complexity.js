// The first algorithm is more efficient in terms of space and
// could work for specific cases where we want to return not only
// the first repeated letter but another position, but in terms of time
// its scaling is inefficient compared to the second algorithm,
// because although the space complexity is slightly lower,
// its efficiency in terms of time complexity is quite reasonable,
// since it was inspired by "Memoization", when we think of scaling it is an
// algorithm that will remain efficient in terms of time.

// In conclusion, I would prefer to use the second algorithm
// when I need to handle large amounts of data,
// but the first one for its simplicity I would not discard it,
// and in fact I would use it if I am sure that the scaling would be controlled.
